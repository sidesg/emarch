# emarch
The goal of this project is to create an archival linked-data description of the the corpus of texts produced by the E2-mi2 using the International Council on Archives' OWL ontology, Records in Contexts (RIC-O).

The files in first_info_gen use data from the Cuneiform Digital Library's catalogue to identify the relevant subset of documents and pull their data. Files in make_rdf use that data to create the RDF triplets describing the E2-mi2 fonds.
